# Neural Network Type Classification | TMNIST

## Overview
This project aims to build a neural network model for classifying the TMNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten characters similar to the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to create a "Hello World" neural network tutorial using the TMNIST data and provide insights into the model's performance and interpretability.

The project uses a variety of datasets from TMNIST, such as TMNIST Alphabet (94 characters) and TMNIST-Glyphs (MNIST Style Glyph images).
## Datasets Used
1. **TMNIST Alphabet (94 characters)**: 94 characters and over 281,000 images
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/nikbearbrown/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters/)

2. **TMNIST-Glyphs (MNIST Style Glyph images)**: Over 500,000 images of 1812 glyphs in 2990 font styles
   - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/nimishmagre/tmnist-glyphs-1812-characters)

## Objectives
- Develop a neural network model for TMNIST classification based on the MNIST tutorial.
- Interpret the model's performance and provide insights into how the model works.
- Ensure the notebook is unique and not a copy of existing tutorials.
- Post the tutorial on Kaggle with a clear explanation.

## Key Requirements
1. **Model Training**
   - Train a neural network model to classify characters from the TMNIST dataset.
   - The model must achieve an accuracy of at least 95% for TMNIST (Typeface MNIST) or 90% for TMNIST Alphabet or TMNIST-Glyphs.
2. **Uniqueness**
   - The notebook should be original and not too similar to existing notebooks on Kaggle.
3. **Explanation**
   - Explain the math, code, and ideas behind the neural network clearly.
   - Include the reasoning behind design choices such as architecture, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.


## Prerequisites
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
- **Environment**: Kaggle Notebook, Google Colab, or Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. **Open the Notebook**: 
   - Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**, **Kaggle**, or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. **Load the Dataset**: 
   - Download the dataset directly from Kaggle and load it into the notebook.
3. **Run the Cells**: 
   - Train and evaluate the model by running all cells sequentially.

## Results
- The project outputs a trained neural network model that classifies the TMNIST characters.
- The accuracy and detailed insights into the model's performance are presented in the notebook.
- Explanation and discussion of model architecture and performance metrics are included to provide a deeper understanding of the process.
